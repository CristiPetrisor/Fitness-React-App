# React + Vite Fitness App

This application is made with vite + react.js technologies. 
The application creates a web page of a fitness room and has several functionalities:
  - The page has the home, hero, program, about us, trainers and contact sections
  - The whole application is responsive, using stylized buttons and different icons
  - In the about section, we have implemented a video player that starts when you click on the image and stops automatically when you exit the player
  - In the trainers section we have 4 cards with image and text that can be scrolled with information about the trainers
  - In the contact section, I created a form with name, phone number and message that are received by me on my personal email.
  - The contact form was also made using an API from web3forms.
  - In the footer I added the copyright, the weather in Bucharest which is used by an API from OpenWeather,
    an integrated map to be able to see the location of the hall and the terms and conditions
